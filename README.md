# MedKLIP: Medical Knowledge Enhanced Language-Image Pre-Training in Radiology

## Introduction:

The official implementation  code for "MedKLIP: Medical Knowledge Enhanced Language-Image Pre-Training in Radiology".

[**Paper Web**](https://chaoyi-wu.github.io/MedKLIP/)

[**Arxiv Version**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02228)

## Quick Start:
Check checkpoints dir to download our pre-trained model. It can be used for all zero-shot && finetuning tasks

* **Zero-Shot Classification:**

    We give an example on CXR14 in ```Sample_Zero-Shot_Classification_CXR14```. Modify the path, and test our model by ```python test.py```
* **Zero-Shot Grounding:**

    We give an example on RSNA_Pneumonia in ```Sample_Zero-Shot_Grounding_RSNA```. Modify the path, and test our model by ```python test.py```
* **Finetuning:**

    We give segmentation and classification finetune code on SIIM_ACR dataset in ```Sample_Finetuning_SIIMACR```. Modify the path, and finetune our model by ```python I1_classification/train_res_ft.py``` or ```python I2_segementation/train_res_ft.py```

## Pre-train:
Our pre-train code is given in ```Train_MedKLIP```.
* Check the ```Train_MedKLIP\data_file``` dir and download the pre-processed data files.
* Modify the path as you disire, and ```python PreTrain_MedKLIP\train_MedKLIP.py``` to pre-train.
